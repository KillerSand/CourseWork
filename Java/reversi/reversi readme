I have created a runnable jar file. The reversi folder contains my code.
The reverrsi program is only a sandbox environment for reversi. You will need to know the rules.
The left side of the program is the reversi play area. The right side has buttons and other information.
The top two text fields show how many pieces each color currently have.
The second row contains two radio buttons that allows you to select which side goes first when a new game is created.
The third row contains two text fields that display the number of wins each side has.
The fourth row contains two radio buttons that allow you to set the size of the board when a new game is created.
The fifth row contains two buttons that starts a new game or ends the current game.
The sixth row contains a button and a text field. The button ends the turn for the current color and allows the other
  color to place pieces. The text field shows how many ties have occured in the session.
The last row shows whose turn it is.
