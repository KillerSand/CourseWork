<h2>Pokemon</h2>
<p>Pokemon is the newest card game that I play. It has the same structure as other games but of course it has its own rules that make it unique.</p>
<p>Pokemon uses a deck of 60 cards for a one on one battle. You can have a total of six pokemon in play. One pokemon as your active and the other 5 on your bench.</p>
<p>Active pokemon can attack other pokemon if they have the required energies attached to them. You can attach one energy from your hand to any of your pokemon once per turn.
    The way to win is by collecting 6 prize cards. You get these prize cards by reducing your opponent's active pokemon's health to zero.</p>
