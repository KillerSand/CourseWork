<p>My Karador deck is a graveyard recursion deck. Karador's effect is that he cost 1 less generic mana to cast for each creature in my graveyard. His second ability allows me to cast 1 creature from my graveyard once per turn. Because of these effects I basically have my graveyard act as an extension of my hand. To complement Karador I have cards that allow me to send cards from my hand or deck to the graveyards. A few examples would be Survival of the Fittest, Fauna Shaman, and Hermit Druid. Most cards in this deck have effects that either send cards to the graveyard, bring cards back from the graveyard, or have effects if they are sent from play into the graveyard.</p>
