<p>My Trostani deck is a life gain deck. The whole purpose for this deck is to gain as much life as possible and use my life advantage to win the game.</p>
<p>Trostani,the commander, has two abilites that helps me do this. The first is "Whenever another creature enters the battlefield under your control, you gain life equal to that creature's toughness". So whenever a creature comes onto my field I gain life equal to its toughness. Toughness is the second number on the bottom right of a creature card. His second ability is called populate. For 1 generic mana, 1 green mana, 1 white mana and tap it: I put a token onto the battlefield that is a copy of a token I already control. For this reason I have cards that produces tokens such as Hornet Queen, Vitu-Ghazi Guildmage, and Armada Wurm to name a few. Because I want to gain life I do not attack very often with my creatures. The way I try to win games are with Aetherflux Reservoir, Felidar Sovereign, and Serra Avatar.</p>
