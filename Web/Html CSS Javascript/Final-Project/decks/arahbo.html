<p>Arahbo is my newest deck that I have made. This deck is cat tribal or cat heavy deck. Arahbo has a unique effect called eminence. This means that the effect attached to it works if it is in the command zone or on the battlefield. This means that regardless if I play Arahbo or not I can still get this effect. The effect is at the beginning of combat another cat creature I control gets +3 power and +3 toughness until the end of the turn. This allows me to beef up one of my cat creatures when I go to attack. I also have equipment in the deck that further improves the combat powers of my cats once I equip them. This deck is a standard beatdown deck in which I try to overpower my opponent.</p>
