This is a web design project that I had worked on for a class.
The website is created to show off one my hobbies. I picked trading card games.
***The magic page looks weird cause I was using an api from tappedout. https://tappedout.github.io/
  But they have been having some problems with it so I will update it once a fixed is found.***
